Good morning, Vinodh. Do we have any news on the subject? In fact it is a bit confusing is this information, "damage status" and "Condition", at first we only had one, but as we have two we could improve. First, I need to know a few things to guide companies on how the "damage status" and "Condition" information should be applied in the system. Second, if we know that the "Condition" is referring to the per Movement type i.e. 'Container Repair Start', 'Container Repair'. What is "Damage Status" related to, as we also have a "condition" with P.T.I? In the example of 3 units shown in the email, we have the process carried out by the company and informing that the units are ok ("damage status"), able to be released to the exporter, but in the "Condition" there is "damage".

Hi Anna, I planned the vessel this morning and am still having some issues. - Every container that I would plan to the vessel would freeze up the screen and say “processing, please wait”, and it kind of ghosted out the screen. - I ended up with some sort of Octopi 500 error, that would shut me out of Octopi. I would have re-open the barge and get everything set up. Not sure if this is an internet connect problem? - When loading containers from the yard to the load list, then putting them on the vessel I still cant tell where I left off in the yard when I go back to load more containers. I have to save the sequence, then refresh the yard page to see where I left off. Before it used to leave a check mark once the container loaded to the vessel. - + symbol to add containers in the yard in groups is back to working. However it’s not working like before. Say I use the + symbol and pick up one row (4 containers), then only need two more. I manually click to add the two to the already four on the load list. I add those to the ship. I go back to my yard still have two containers left in the previous row, if I press the + symbol to pick up the two and keep using the + symbol for the rest of the stack, it picks up all of those plus the previous two that were already loaded to the vessel. This didn’t used to pick up containers that were already on the vessel. Now these are on the load list again, and move slots on the ship. I realize this is probably hard to understand via email. I’m open to a phone call if needed.

It may be best for us to have a discussion with Jim once you had a chance to review and respond to all of the questions within. This way we can review the entire process and make sure everyone is on the same page. I was under the impression that Octopi had the 30 day policy but maybe I misunderstood.

Thanks Anna. This is the first time I have looked into the free and pro-rated storage billing so it may just be that I need to understand the process. Tara -- To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to .

Below are the questions. These are noted on the spreadsheet as well. 1) Free 30 day period & calculation for the pro-rated storage fees. a. The “tax date” in Octopi is set to 2/18/20. This should set the free 30 day period to 2/18/20 - 3/18/20, correct? The first billable day should be 3/19/20. b. The number of prorated billing days shows as 11 days. If the free period ends on 3/18/20 the billable days should be 13, from 3/19/20 to 3/31/20. The last two columns on the stock transfer report show the dates as I have them listed here “Storage Start Date 3/19/20” and “Storage End Date 3/31/20”. Using calendar days this totals 13 days however Jim Bailey has advised that the billing is processed as if each month has 30 days. If this is the case the billable days would be 12 not 11 as shown on the storage report. See attached Line item Invoice Report. 2) Description on Line Item Invoice Report a. The description is incorrect. The description suggests that the bill is for storage from 2/18/20 through 3/19/20.. b. The billing SD936 in the attached is for stock that arrived at the port on 2/18/2020, received 30 days free and is now being a pro-rated invoice for the remainder of March 2020. Current description on the Line Item Invoice reads, “MTO Schedule Rebar Storage (2.96) - SD936 #9-30-GR60 WHITE - 11.335 Metric Tons - From February 18, 2020 to March 19, 2020 (11 days)” -The bill should say 3/19 through the end of the month. 3) Truck Loading line items for Stamford a. There are several line items charging for truck loading to Stamford. These are releases of material directly from Stamford’s account. From:JBailey “Truck loading is billed in advance. Octopi was at one point creating a Breakbulk Delivery billable using a storage tariff. They corrected that some time ago. Please create a support ticket pointing to the example you found.” • There is a tariff under Stamford’s account in Octopi for truck loading. The audit logs shows it was updated in February 2020, this update may have triggered the billing to become active again. **Attached is an excel spreadsheet that I put together real quick to show the dates as I think they should be. Row 50 has the calculated dates for the storage for this billing period with a storage start date of 2/18/2020. Row 338-396 is the calculation for next February. In this instance, there is no date ending in February 30 day period. What impact will this have on the billing, if any?

Mandy, Sorry, I can only recall the warning messages related to booking not found for the containers. On invalid containers, I do remember we discussed the requirement with Jason, but on the interim, he directed us to Container ISO invalid Report for our reference/correction in OCTOPI.

Anna, Out of the 3 point listed by Shannon, I have seen a fix to only item #1 #2 – still requires a refresh of the yard areas instead of auto updating to reflect what has been loaded to the vessel. #3 – Printing is still an issue. This is for both yard scans and vessel bays. Really need this fixed. Having to reconfigure margins and/or scale for each vessel or bay plan is not working. Also, we can only scale down so much before its almost impossible for these guys to read the bay plans. **Thanks,** ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/LRQ8N7t2f9jS1zO83hTwEnk40/?name=image001.png) **Mandy GATES** **Marine Superintendent, OPS** ** ** **APL (America) LLC** Direct line: 907.581.8600 Cell: 907.359.3366 1125 East Point Road Dutch Harbor, AK 99692 **www.apl.com** ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/ES3j9KjlmKGQyu7BfAo3mCxQ1/?name=image002.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/8E20CcOysmfkRHR4Cbb5Y5GyI/?name=image004.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/AE7wfcSAux6TOecZD8R4bJFwX/?name=image006.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/X2D0LC4gCbDPrtGs6CM8gOroO/?name=image008.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/2sewMRkcaBbuEEbTd49Z45qbb/?name=image010.jpg) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/gQKYRQbgaeU7Iixmftip550Q9/?name=image012.jpg) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/0etFnNd8eYlQTyGmSn0UEawRW/?name=image014.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/fELvBQ4KvY0KK31h5JMu1HBDC/?name=image015.png) ![Email Banner_Awards 2018](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/vozIiutvh3Bz7miBwC6EBKFOn/?name=image016.jpg) _ _ _This message is Intended for the recipient(s) named above._ _It may contain confidential or privileged information. _ _If you are not the ntended recipient, please notify the_ _sender immediately by repl ying to this message and then_ _delete it from your system.

Luz / Anna, While I am unsure about ISO warnings and where those conversations went or ended, what I do know is that at one time we had the system set up to where it would not “create” new containers off of a CSV upload. There were warnings that the container status would not update so as to not create bad numbers. This would force the user to make a manual update to the system to create the container therefore forcing us to verify the container number before doing so. We are aware of the view CSV upload, but this does nothing to alert us to simple mistakes. We look at hundreds of numbers each day and nothing on this screen is going to stand out to us. The above mentioned fix that once was in place is what we need back. **Thanks,** ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/g3IkyFJ0aQhE79KCA8mYVDWav/?name=image001.png) **Mandy GATES** **Marine Superintendent, OPS** ** ** **APL (America) LLC** Direct line: 907.581.8600 Cell: 907.359.3366 1125 East Point Road Dutch Harbor, AK 99692 **www.apl.com** ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/7OFq1KZaaQGG3CP2BxfY5GFvx/?name=image015.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/6ed9kDrxXWBpjzyLdUx7pvQKV/?name=image016.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/FJdzYu1TbVQTM1DJyua94v3IV/?name=image017.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/JSr7amzkqH1MX0OcmEqDqx2BQ/?name=image018.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/xW0kTcDfzYyG1EZ1VLMmR3xze/?name=image019.jpg) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/mE5cdew5aalZDkumAxzvLOvJF/?name=image020.jpg) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/pAFqHWEvepERP83bG6JqTnKUV/?name=image008.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/Y6arn64E6zPKj4NYWBSOsHwAZ/?name=image009.png) ![Email Banner_Awards 2018](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/jJwDRPmu8ZKuDcExXE9unp33s/?name=image021.jpg) _ _ _This message is Intended for the recipient(s) named above._ _It may contain confidential or privileged information. _ _If you are not the ntended recipient, please notify the_ _sender immediately by repl ying to this message and then_ _delete it from your system.

Dear Anna, Everything is OK now. Thank you !!! I have another request. I would like to be able to produce and export reports (Excel, PDF) with the Logistics account by period . The report must show : 1. Container / size / Carrier / Client name / Delivery or return address / Delivery or return date / Driver’s name / Plate number / Chassis number / Vessel’s information. Also we need to create an historical report by client. I would really appreciate if this is possible. Again thank you.

Adding Mandy… Hi Anna, No expected changes required in LARA as the list of containers via CSV upload file came from the customers, not LARA. As per my recollection of what has been fixed, upon barge upload, OCTOPI will validate the file, show list of**ALL** errors/warnings found for DUT users review. It is up to the user if he/she wanted to proceed with the upload despite of the errors/warnings. The Container with invalid ISO report is a reference for DUT users for clean up later. Thanks and regards, ![cid:image008.png@01D4906B.6F36A6A0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/me9HgeDKAO9pMs8EVQiReZ8L5/?name=image001.png) **Luzviminda P Santos** **IT Terminals Group – Regional Lead (Americas)** Direct line : +602-586-4770 Mobile : +925 876-6503 **www.cma-cgm.com** ![Description : cid:image002.png@01D2F0C6.6078DC50](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/dHkv8XA6ckPgJXLUqo0x0XkNu/?name=image002.png) ![cid:image001.png@01D4F316.150E8450](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/DTuuXEXRhyg8YhZLQivjyGpyV/?name=image003.png) ![cid:image003.png@01D4A751.3A5C8B00](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/ObNV22PpLf2CnbiWNQJhUzVgW/?name=image004.png) -- To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to .

During enhancement updates, we are noticing that when doing the CSV uploads in the movement screen the program is again allowing bad containers to be IN GATE and OUT GATE. We had at one time fixed this so that this would not happen but are seeing it more and more. Please see attached. This was an empty container that was brought in off a barge move with a CSV file. Customer had mis-typed the container number and the system allowed for manual creation instead of rejecting. Correct container number is TRIU8734317.

Hello, I've been planning the vessel today and have run into several issues. It's looking like in between all that the new updates went live? 1) Can no longer take groups of yard areas while planning using the + symbol. 2) Can no longer see which containers have been loaded to you your load list, and planned to the vessel. Once planned you have to confirm sequence, then refresh all pages you were using to see where you left off. It's not auto updating the yard once planned to the vessel, and save sequence. 3) Trying to print yard areas and everything is now cut off between pages. It's not keeping yard stacks with stack numbers. It's all being cut off. ------------------ Submitted from: https://app.octopi.co/voyages/214321/yard_scan

Good morning Nirav There will be an investigation into this matter so full details will be required on the movements of the container. For example, I suspect that this container was sent to the queue, added to the load list, showed up as overshipped, tallied to the loading tally, removed from the loading tally (hence, removed from the load list), added to the load list as an empty container, then tallied to the load tally. We need all of the movements Regards, Sheldon Layne ---- Original Message ---- From: "Octopi Support (Octopi Knowledge Base)" Sent: 3/28/2020 1:50:21 AM To: "Sheldon Layne" Subject: [Octopi Knowledge Base] Re: HLBU2393431 The above container was shipped out in... table td { border-collapse: collapse; } body[dir=rtl] .directional_text_wrapper { direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed; } -- To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to .

This is a follow-up to your previous request #3366 "RE: Stock Transfer Billing" Hi Anna, I am just getting back to this. Sorry for the delay. The file downloaded as a result of running the Octopi “Stock Transfer Report” does not contain data in the remarks field for either of the ID’s. I reviewed the file that was attached the original email and also reran the report this morning and both have no data in the remarks field for 4745455 and 4745755. Attached is the report that was run today. The ID’s can be found on line 682 and 702. 4745455 does not have data on the downloaded file which matches the data displayed in the Octopi screen. 4745755 does not have data on the downloaded file, however as the screenshot shows, it should have 26954.

Hi Guille, I used another export release for these cases. I have tried copying and pasting it but it wouldn’t work. I also tried with different spacing in the beginning of the export release but that didn’t work either. I didn’t try the spacing between cont and 40 however. **Marc-Aleix Gardère** **Director of Operations** **Caribbean Port Services (CPS) S.A. ** Complexe APN, boulevard La Saline Port au Prince, Haïti T: +509 28 103141 M: +509 3702-1588Web: www.cps.ht > On Mar 21, 2020, at 14:30, Octopi Support (Octopi Knowledge Base) wrote: -- To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to .

Hello Anna, Sorry for the delayed response. When you say the first line, are you referring to the UNB segment? No change will be required for this segment. We are not changing our EDI ID.

Yalien let me know what units are trying to send. Berth was done as a virtual yard when the process was stablished and done by Octopi and Gdz. Units being discharged from vessels nb, will be discharged at Berth, and the Rcve/ or Rcvf will be done when the containers enter the intended Storage yards West as empty and South as full. If they are Crowley units and were discharged at Berth, they can be sent to Crowley yard if this is the case.. Now the only issues I have been seeing with Berth features that the discharge off the vessel and the Rcve is done at the same time Causing the moves to overlap and having errors since the function was done to have a chain of custody,.. ** ** **Ariel Araoz** Operations / Equipment Department /King Ocean Agency, Inc. _As agents for__KING OCEAN SERVICES__®_ 11000 NW 29th Street, Suite 201 Doral, Florida - 33172 T: 305-597-1371 / F:305-597-1384/ C: 305-733-9815 E-mail:ariel.araoz@kingocean.com /http://kingocean.com _The contents of this e-mail message and any attachments are confidential and are intended solely for addressee.

Good morning team, Please note that when we are working a vessel and claiming containers we are experiencing some delay. When the container arrives at the yard and we enter the container in the Filter, the container shows up and is claimed. Before the system would take us back to the work queue page. Now the previous containers number stays in the Filter field and we have to do a backspace to erase it which is less efficient and time consuming. Is it possible to go fix that for us please?

Hi Vinodh, I am not able to open below links. Please note that we do not manipulate the seal information. If there’s an additional seal at the time of unloading we insert it.

We used to have the margins figured out and it was the same for each hatch. I noticed about a month or two ago that something had changed with the margins. We were no longer able to use the margins we had figured out, they needed adjusting again, and each hatch was different margins. Yes, we have done 16 across.

For instance if the consignee issues a release # 1234 for 1,000 bundles of four different line items, Octopi generates four stock transfer invoices. Is there a way for Octopi to trigger that billable event based on the stock transfer order number. Not sure if setting up that way protects us from errors with duplicates, but would like to know if it’s possible. Also, any word on stock transfer report duplicates?

Good morning Support Team, Both EDI’s are wrong per my understanding- CAIU8423171" and STUFFED to "HLBU1356562 Normally, CAIU8423171should be in EMPTY status right after the STRI move to show the correct status of the container. HLBU1356562 Should be in STUFFED if the CAIU8423171 has been transferred to HLBU1356562. To clarify, for any STRI move, the GIMT status has to be inserted right after as requested by Hapag LIoyd. Now, I need to correct the moves manually to avoid delay in the corrections. Best regards, Myrline D.

Good morning ECMU2199732 was used as an example. When this container was planned for stuffing and before anything was done with the container in terms of stuffing cargo, it could not be deleted. Nothing is to be done with this container. VICU4444483 could not be removed from the stuffing tallies. THe manager had to start the container and complete it even though nothing was stuffed into the container (see below). This needs to be deleted from the stuffing tallies.

Reefer Containers- Destination Code Reefer contaners to be delivered direct to consignees and those stripped at BICO all have a delivery type as "Gate". When running reports, there is no easy way to determine if the container has been stripped at BICO or delivered through the North Gate because as mentioned, all have the delivery type as "Gate". However, these can be diffrentiated in Octopi by using the destination code from the bill of lading screen in conjuction with the deliery type. The destination code for reefers going through the gate is "Container Park'" while the destination code for the containers stripped at BICO is "Bico". PLease add the destination code to reports. It can start with the reefer pluggin report. Also add the destination code as a filter. ------------------ Submitted from: https://app.octopi.co/octopi-reports/reefer_plugging?utf8=%E2%9C%93&options%5Bplugged_in_by_id%5D=&options%5Busage%5D=2&options%5Bdelivery_type%5D=0&options%5Bstill_plugged_in%5D=YES&options%5Bmin_hours%5D=&options%5Bmax_hours%5D=&options%5Bstart_date%5D=2020-02-01+12%3A00+AM&options%5Bend_date%5D=2020-03-07+10%3A59+PM&commit=Submit

Good morning Vinodh, Please see below for answers in red; 1) What do you mean by a 'new operation'? –XPO is bringing in empties, WWT is picking them up to get loaded at another facility and then brings them back loaded. They then exchange the loaded container for an empty and repeat the process. 2) How are you pulling up empties? –We are not pulling the empties, XPO is. 3) Are you looking for a booking number in the Container Inventory screen? –The empties that we receive are brought in under a certain booking. We need to be able to see what that booking number is from the container inventory screen. When I logged into Octopi this morning, I was able to see the booking number on the empties from the container inventory screen. I believe it has been resolved!!

Thanks Nirav for your update – so I understand the cargo was changed location by doing undo for it in the tally page so the location was changed but the total tallied weight was not affected by this change, correct? If yes, I believe the tally should have been decreased by the quantity moved to berth the same when undo container loading it decreases the completed containers to match the actuals. ![Logo](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/7Qr8ibw12t3z2vayIe2zAFqS2/?name=image005.png) **Hossam Ibrahim** IT Manager Phone: +202 26142870/1/2 ext: 110 Mobile: +201 068844953 E-mail: Hossamh@iaccholdings.com Plot (45B) North 90 St. New Cairo, Egypt ![LinkedIn icon](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/dvOljpqy47vJWdk9UlPiC8NPS/?name=image006.jpg) ![Twitter icon](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/KArvX4SOQjgWtJF4PWl113Ha9/?name=image007.jpg) ![Instagram icon](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/bRd3MCuauJ8FpQJYsBRZeVlPl/?name=image008.png) Please consider your environmental responsibility before printing this e-mail This e-mail and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or organization to whom they are addressed.

Hi Vinodh, This can certainly wait for Anna to return tomorrow. Attached are the meeting notes I am referring to. It was found that the delete function should never be used to fix an incorrect stock transfer. Since it should never be used, I feel the best solution is to remove it as an option. Doing so will eliminate the chance that someone deletes a stock transfer which has the potential to cause cargo to disappear.

Hey Anna, Thank you and your team for investigating this issue. For Bill of Lading, KKLUTH0903436, 12 API calls occurred because 12 vehicles were assigned to that BL. However, for each vehicle called, a duplicate vehicle was created at the same time as the original, one ID apart. i.e. 1617042 & 1617043. These duplicate records are not assigned to any Bill of Ladings, arrival voyage, nor have any movements. We will check on our end for any instances where the cargo is listed twice, and monitor future transactions.

Hi Anna, Meeting notes from the Stock Transfer and Undo Functions. If the Stock Transfer “Delete” function should not be used under any circumstance; it should be removed/disabled. Doing so would remove the chance of human error. Is there a permission that we can disable on user accounts. In Addition: It would be helpful if you could review all of our user account permissions to see if we face risk in other areas that we haven’t considered yet. Perhaps a “Delete” should require the consent of a second user with Administrator permissions. **Tara Russian** **Inventory Specialist** **PCI Fairless Hills, LLC** **267-800-3065** -- To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to octopi.support+unsubscribe@navis.com.

Hey Guys, One of the users, Vincent Jones, conducted a reefer_plug_in movement on container: TCLU1051546 without having the ‘Reefer Plugging: Write’ permission. This container was not calculating a plugged-in duration, however, when the container was plugged in a second time, the duration was calculated. Vincent's plug-in movement was deleted, allowing the container to be processed. See details below: Voyage: BALTIC KLIPPER 2020020202 Bill of Lading: 20004VLBG007 Container: TCLU1051546 Delete Movement ID: 53872 Note, Vincent Jones reefer plug in movement was missing the ‘Goods’ and ‘Container Arrival Voyage’ fields.

Hello Vinodh, We are a third party that CPS has given access to OCTOPI to facilitate our work. I guess having the "Terminal reports" permission will give us access to other reports that we are not allowed to view. Marc Aleix is the right person to decide if we can get the "Terminal reports" permission or if we have to wait until your product is able to grant access to specific reports for a predefined role.

Can you make it so when you are editing a tariff item, that after you hit "Save" and are sent back to the item's detail page that there is a button at the bottom that you can click that will let you go back to the customer's tariff page (that has been refreshed to show the tariff items has been updated). Currently I have to hit back twice on my browser and then refresh.

Positive, Anna all this information is important and clear. For me this ticket is closed, I will post just one remark to be discussed with a team ... It would create Damage specific (container damage) by company ... then it would be able to, together with the outsourced companies, classify a damaged unit and who is responsible for updating the damage status of the container. Example: Reeferbras (outsourced) - Container machinery Damage.

Good morning, Vinodh. Thank you for the information, I'm making adjustments to the system. To anticipate information on this case, according to the personnel who performed the gate in and gate out procedure of the CMAU1951760 unit, they reported that it was not appearing in the system, so they created another unit causing this bug. Sorry for the return, I'm off on Wednesdays and Thursdays. I believe it has been resolved, but please try to identify why this unit did not appear at the time of gate out and gate in so that it does not happen again. **Atenciosamente,** **Best regards,** ** ** **Daniel CRISANTO** **Assistente de Operações / Handler / Data Quality** **Progeco Natal – RN - BR** Direct line:+55(84) 3222 4502 Mobile:+55(84) 99962-1347 nat.dcrisanto@progecobr.com ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/FkJm4QKcHaUfKa9xtcx0AgF7y/?name=image001.png) ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/ujy7o0jbcje9CE0QuwV3y8S74/?name=image002.png) **_Confidentiality Notice_** _The information contained in this email message may be privileged and confidential.

Hi: I would like to share my findings here. The problem was that a booking was created with multiple lines and a big number of items on each line so it was used for a while with no problem, once the booking reached the top then the EDI messages fail. I edited the booking as a running one and then I was able to resend all the EDI messages. The interesting part is that is was hard to find the problem because the error message was confusing us. In my opinion this error should not be named “EDI message was successfully created but failed to send”, if Octopi can not send the EDI due to a booking is full then the error should describe the actual problem. Please review and let us know if this is possible.

We are using the gate movements report (https://app.octopi.co/octopi-reports/gate_movements) but we noticed that the in movement are missing the departure voyage information.

Hey Guys, We encountered an issue adding vehicles when planning the loading tally for voyage ADMIRAL BAY 3 (2020020229). There is no ‘Add Vehicle’ button when planning a loading list, as a workaround, we attempted to update the cargo type to breakbulk, add the cargo to the loading list, and revert the cargo type to vehicle. However, this was unsuccessful because, although the cargo was added to the loading list, the cargo of type vehicle was not visible. See the attached image. We are requesting an Add Vehicle button to the loading list screen that filters by VIN, and making cargo of type vehicle visible in the loading tally screen. Ideally, the VIN would be displayed in both the loading list and loading tally screens, allowing the clerks to differentiate between the vehicles. Please let us know if there is anything you can do to assist.

Hello CETUSLAB Team, We have an X-PRESS TAJUMULCO Ship that we used to work for, for the X-Press line (ENMARCOLDA). Now we have come with a new ORINOCO vessel which has the same configuration as the X-PRESS TAJUMULCO for this same maritime line. By wanting to create it (ORINOCO) on OCTOPI, the system does not allow us, because it still considers the old name (X-PRESS TAJUMULCO). One has the impression that the same ship has changed its name. We have considered ORINOCO, but we note that all the old Ships Worked on the name of X-PRESS TAJUMULCO change to ORINOCO. Since this can cause a serious problem with the accounting for any audit, we would therefore like to consider the two names on OCTOPI (X-PRESS TAJUMULCO and ORINOCO) Thank you for helping us.

Dear Vinodh, Many thanks for your last. Please note that we usually deliver the empty units and receive back the full units so the unit is already registered in our system. But when we receive a full unit that is coming from another source and is not previously registered here, upon performing the upload of the full units for export the system is not registering those units as full export! It is registering the unit as unknown! Therefore, when we take a full unit yard inventory to send it to customs authorities those units are not there! We have to always count the total of units to be loaded and in case of any discrepancy we have to go back to the loading list and check one by one in order to find the units not registered and we found out that those units were not delivered here. Anyhow, we understand that no matter what the system must recognize the units on a loading list upload to be 100% of full export units. Pleased to hear from you and many thanks in advance.

Hey Guys, The Marine department requested a report that would capture the berthing duration for a vessel, which would be the time the pilot board the vessel to the time the vessel is berth. The report should allow the user to filter by a date range, vessel type and any other attributes you find appropriate. See attachment for two examples of the columns/data that should be displayed.

Boa tarde, octopi. Foi identificado uma falha no "reefer Pre Trip." Quando é informado pela primeira vez... colocando como "failed", a informação permance no container até este momento está correto, porém quando é realizado o segundo "pre Trip Inspection" como "ok", a mudança no PTI status não ocorre... permancendo como Failed. Verificar com equipe falha e realizar correção, pois estamos conseguindo realizar gate out de container "sem PTI". ------------------ Submitted from: https://app.octopi.co/containers/1460549

Both moves came in on 1/23 on two separate files. Both moves came in with same transaction date and time of 1/23 @ 5:32 PM (which is the first problem as I know It cannot both Discharge and Receive Empty at same exact time). Additionally the RCVE message (file) came in at 5:32 PM followed by the DCHE message at 5:42 PM. Therefore the RCVE got processed first, then the DCHE which I guess is the 2nd problem. Other than that, both files were processed as expected. Hope this helps.

Boa tarde, Octopi. Estamos com uma situação para ser resolvida no sistema sobre a voyage. Segue caso abaixo: Na voyage marfret guyane - 0rt56n1ma. Foi realizado o embarue de 328 units, está informação está correta, 14 units não embarcaram, no qual ficaria com 342. Na discharge temos 251 que também está correta. No Restow (shifting) temos 80 unidades. Totalizando L-328+D-251+R-160(80) = 739 UNITS/MOV. Segue o problema abaixo: Tivemos que descarrregar 17 units, no qual 1 não estava no planejamento de restow e foi acrecentado(81), e 16 units que já contia no restow planejado. Precisamos que o registro dos movimentos permaneça no restow e sejá criado a descarga desta unidades, ao mesmo tempo essa informação seja atualiza no TDR e departure baplie(sem as 17 unit). Totalizando com estas informações L-328+D-268+R-160(80) = 756 UNITS/MOV. Como realizar este tipo de ajuste da melhor forma? ------- Good afternoon, Octopi. We have a situation to be solved in the system about the voyage. Below is the case: Na voyage marfret guyane - 0rt56n1ma. 328 units were loaded, this information is correct, 14 units did not board, which would be 342(false). In the discharge we have 251 which is also correct. In the Restow (shifting) we have 80 units. Totaling L-328 + D-251 + R-160 (80) = 739 UNITS / MOV. The problem is as follows: We had to unload 17 units, in which 1 was not in the restow planning and was added (81), and 16 units that were already in the planned restow. We need the record of movements to remain in the restow and to create the unloading of these units, at the same time that information is updated in the TDR and departure baplie (without the 17 units). Totaling with this information L-328 + D-268 + R-160 (80) = 756 UNITS / MOV.

Essas unidades estão presentes no plano de restow do navio. As unidades restow ficam na lista e nelas temos dois movimentos. Quando desce tem o botão de descarga e ao descer tem o botão de load pra poder embarcar a unidade. Eu creio que vocês tem autonomia pra poder deixar a unidade como se ainda não tivesse sido embarcada.

Hi Anna, I am attempting to update the yard map with the current location of cargo. Location L2 shows there are 16 “containers”. The first page shows 10 of the 16 but the options to go to the next page are not working. I tried all three options: 2, Next> and Last>> Please have someone take a look and enable the next page function.

Good evening team, Please note that there are many discrepancies with the unloading information compared to what was actually manifested. For example for the MV SARA EXPRESS it shows 39/63 unloaded. However the manifest indicates 39 to unload and that’s the amount that was physically unloaded. Can you please have a look for us? ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/wKnMBC8fAhLxd7aSFDKwJSRiB/?name=IMG_5926.jpg) **Marc-Aleix Gardère** **Director of Operations** **Caribbean Port Services (CPS) S.A. ** Complexe APN, boulevard La Saline Port au Prince, Haïti T: +509 28 103141 M: +509 3702-1588Web: www.cps.ht -- To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to octopi.support+unsubscribe@navis.com.

Hi: As shown in below image when users interchange out a chassis, Octopi is not recording where the unit is going to, then we have to wait for the chassis to be entered in another terminal to know the chassis location. We also noticed that “Consignee .NOT AVAILABLE.” Is been read from the booking (which is a GDZ requirement). Is it possible to force the user to enter a destination during the gate out process? Is it possible to override the value on the “from” column with the current location of the chassis due to it is an out movement? Maybe using the consignee value on the “To” column is a better option. I think this is what Octopi does when an empty container is been gate out with a booking. We tried with transfers but that works for containers only. Please let us know how can Octopi help.

Hi Anna, That is the correct cargo to zero out. I have noted the support email address and will CC when sending emails for support. Thanks, Tara **From:** Blackstone, Anna **Sent:** Wednesday, January 22, 2020 2:18 PM **To:** Tara Russian **Cc:** James Bailey PC ; Daren Shiles ; octopi.support@navis.com **Subject:** Re: Update to cargo needed Hi Tara, I hope you had a good weekend. I will get with a developer to have the qty of this cargo set to 0. Can you please just confirm this is the exact cargo by going to the link before I ask someone to complete this task? https://app.octopi.co/containers/953151 Also, for your question regarding the exhausted cargo. Currently, the only way to see this is just as you have done, by using the Delivery Report. I can bring this situation to the product team to think on it for a future solution. But for now, you'll have to stick with using the Delivery Report. And, I have cc'd the support email address on this reply so that a ticket will be created for this request. In the future, can you please also add the support email to any of your requests?

Hi: Can Octopi change the column “current status” to “status”? In below image the two empty containers were actually discharged as full containers (they went out and came back empty). If we query the BL to see how many units came full or empty this column affect the results. I’m not 100 % sure but I suspect that some reports have the same problem.

Good morning For vehicle carriers, each vehicle will have a separate line item similar to a container vessel. So that when vehicles are being tallied, they can only be accurately tallied by entering the Vin number or the partial Vin number. Use the Hoegh Caribia 2020010088 as an example. This vessel has only 191 vehicles to tally. The clerk must be able to enter the Vin number to tally. Imagine if the vessel had over 500 vehicles. This really is a show-stopper.

Hi Anna, Thank you for looking into this for us – We label them as “agents” only because they only need to see their inventory, not all our other customers. Is labeling a customer an agent the only way we can keep them seeing other inventories? Schuyler seems ok with us updating them about their inspected containers for right now, but the faster we can give them the ability to access certain reports, the better. Regarding the other customers, they are labeled as agents and will need to see the same reports as well. Again, thank you for your help with this! Let me know if you need anything from me.

Good morning, Octopi. We have a serious problem that must be corrected urgently, as damaged units are leaving the terminal, the system is allowing the units to be released. In this case we have several units that after container inspection somehow generated container damage without the user informing that the unit is defective. Following attachment situation (bug), we are being questioned with CMA CGM. We need to avoid this situation, we also don't know if any updates are performed..., but it is negatively affecting together with CMA CGM. ------------------ Submitted from: https://app.octopi.co/tallies/8199/reports

If we clear it out right before you start the testing or claiming the items that are being stripped, it will be a better experience because you will not have such a large queue of items from old voyages pushing the new items out of view.

That is why the search does not bring up any items for the container and voyage you are trying. Now that I have pinpointed the issue, I am going to meet with the development team to see what we can do for this to prevent it in the future. I will have more info for you soon. Thanks! Anna ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b0d7e4e15bc923e4c3c2549f2a399de6?size=40&default=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.zendesk.com%2Fimages%2F2016%2Fdefault-avatar-80.png&r=g) **Andrew Grant** Jan 14, 8:31 AM EST Good Day: Thanks for your quick response.

Hi: We were trying to edit the cargo (https://app.octopi.co/containers/1484987 ) for the DR (https://app.octopi.co/dock_receipts/9875 ) and we found the following problems. 1. Once a DR is stuffed if you try to edit the cargo the edit form show an error due to the current location. (current location type: container, current location: id is not prepopulated on the new form) 2. We changed the width from 196 inches to 106 inches and somehow all the dimensions were affected. ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/K1ZDkJVT4T6EJAeiNFcdcRdAQ/?name=image001.png) Please advise how to fix this entry.

Hi Vinodh: When the terminal needs to delete a Dock Receipt is because an error on the entry or a rejection of the cargo after submitting the entry in Octopi. So when we delete a DR the cargo needs to be deleted as well to avoid confusions and keep accurate inventory. We can do it manually but is hard to identify a cargo created by a DR once you delete the DR. Only special users can delete DR and when they do it is approved by the management. Personally I think it will help us a lot the cascade delete from the buttons in below image. ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/tj5CSGRsTesmxchVxM5G6hnKd/?name=image001.png) Regards, Yordan Santallana **IT Department** |**Sun Terminals, Inc. ** 4610 McIntosh Rd. | Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316 Phone: 954-524-8600 Ext. 5509 | Cellphone: 754-777-3755 yordan.santallana@sunterminals.com|http://www.kingocean.com -- To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to .

Hi: Can Octopi please review the EDI messages process and let us know if below problem is on Octopi? If positive con you somehow search for more containers with this problem?

Please notice that the last line is missing the tilde (~). It actually is on the following line by itself. Because the tilde plays an important role (end of line indicator), it is vital that it is in the right place and that each line ends with it. Please ask Octopi to review this and see if they can prevent it. I will see what I can do from our side but again because it is the end of line indicator, it really should be there.

Realizar ajuste para o tdr, pois a opção de transformar restow em discharge não funciona de forma completa e sim parcial, faltando dados no TDR e na lista de discharge.

Hi Anna, I had already answered Vinodh. "Vinodh is not similar to ticket 3139 (whether the genset is in the terminal or not when entering or leaving), would be the complement to ticket 3035 (stating whether the container and genset are in or out with their Shipperline).“ **trying to explain situation below:** ticket 3139 During a Gate In or Gate Out operation, the system alerts us about the information of the gensets that allow to be identified that the genset is in the terminal or not (outside). In entering the data, we are having a genset number error, because some units have similar numbers and the visibility is not clear. in this case above prevent them from completing Gate In or Gate Out. ticket 3035 During a Gate In or Gate Out operation on the system. We want an alert to notify the user that the chosen Container & Genset does not have the same shipping line. This alert should notify the user of the difference in shipping lines and not prevent them from completing Gate In or Gate Out. (It would be the most flexible way) The above assumption is correct. sorry for the grammatical errors, I'm using translator. **Atenciosamente,** **Best regards,** ** ** **Daniel CRISANTO** **Assistente de Operações / Handler / Data Quality** **Progeco Natal – RN - BR** Direct line:+55(84) 3222 4502 Mobile:+55(84) 99962-1347 nat.dcrisanto@progecobr.com ![Description: cid:image010.png@01D2F1C2.531796D0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/o8iBi1sNDfPzBrmh5j3twQhYL/?name=image001.png) ![Description: Description : cid:image002.png@01D2F0C6.6078DC50](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/1h7CxkOIxH9cQktEG5LJwpykD/?name=image002.png) **_Confidentiality Notice_** _The information contained in this email message may be privileged and confidential.

Tally Verification Good morning We have been experiencing some challenges in using the tally verification for the stripping of containers as well as for breakbulk vessels, so much so that the verification is only used for container vessels. Our request was NOT to show the quantities being tallied by the port clerk. However, if the quantities are not shown, there is no real way for the SAB to match the entries espeicillay in the case where there are multiple entries for the same Consignee. As such, I am requesting that the quantities be now shown which should aid without the verification process by the SAB clerk.

Hi Vinodh: I think I did not explain well. The feature that is not working fine is the one that turns the seal box red or green when the user start typing the seal value.

Hey Guys, Our usage code for Ship Stores was updated from code 26 to 30. This change resulted with the usage for the Bill of Lading and Container to be set as Unknown and not transshipment. See Example: Bill of Lading: IBC0558624 Link: https://app.octopi.co/bol_segments/429789 We are requesting to have the previous code 26 to be updated to 30. Thanks again for the assistance.

Hey Sebastien, The screen which returned the 500 error was the Yard Areas List, https://app.octopi.co/yard_areas?view=list, but at the moment I can access the screen. As for your suggestion to place the cargo at the Terminal and then relocate to Yard Area, this would get the task completed. However, we prefer to have the Yard Area re-added to avoid the clerks making unnecessary changes to the cargo location and movements when they only have to amend the quantity from 1 to 2 or update the consignee from James to Jamal.

Foca. Octopi must create change requests for the container that has the same position as it must be moved to get the units below it and then put it in place, often hazmat units that have their specific place that can not change. **Atenciosamente,** **Best regards,** ** ** **Daniel CRISANTO** **Assistente de Operações / Handler / Data Quality** **Progeco Natal – RN - BR** Direct line:+55(84) 3222 4502 Mobile:+55(84) 99962-1347 nat.dcrisanto@progecobr.com ![Description: cid:image010.png@01D2F1C2.531796D0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/Bwe608IR1LmEUNxA5koAUehH8/?name=image001.png) ![Description: Description : cid:image002.png@01D2F0C6.6078DC50](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/DTyT6uH9Q3fin0sFfHepPr17k/?name=image002.png) **_Confidentiality Notice_** _The information contained in this email message may be privileged and confidential.

Good afternoon everyone. we are having problem with information in the inventory of units in the terminal. In the case of suitable units (ok) or defective (damage). We have examples of the units that did "pre trip inspection". Company ReeferBras input for data, the units it is ok or failed. In this situation, the failed units should have "Damage" in inventory. Almost all units are in **good working condition** even witchfailed. It has no logic. Should be... "Ok", fit for use. "Damage", malfunction. We need to be analyzed and adjusted this information that is entered by Reeferbras and BM.

Overlanded Cargo Breakbulk Please check the discharge tallies for 2019121254. There is cargo being identified as still to be discharged with multiple entries but for the same consignee. When selecting the cargo to go to movements, the cargo appears to be overlanded. How does overlanded work for breakbulk? Is this an error that needs to be fixed?

Hi Anna, Yes, we intend to abolish the use of temp letter delivery at the terminal. This is causing a lot of problems and claims to the Line as shippers are changing this information at several stages of the process. Anyhow, the intention is to compare temp info at Octopi with physical settings at the containers. If its not the same we will not receive the unit. Either the system must be updated (by the shipper) or the container setting must be updated (also by the shippers instructions to the reefer service company) only after this we will receive the unit. Therefore as CMA CGM have an interface system where shippers do all by themselves, updating booking information we need octopi to be updated as well upon performing every andupload. Specially the temperature settings. I will double check about the update performed to this booking since it was done by cma cgm documentation team in Santos as part of our testing. Will ask them to do it again ok?

We are testing booking upload updates and the system is not updating the containers temperatures. we created booking BMA0138891 with 3 units with temp of 7º then we made an update in Lara system with different temperatures. later on we performed a booking list upload but the temperature were not updated. this tool is becoming very important to the company since they are trying to abolish the letter of temperature delivered at the gate in/out process but the system must also update the temperature of the reefer units. pleased to hear from you on above. ------------------ Submitted from: https://app.octopi.co/bookings/386154

Hi: Can Octopi please look at this DR 191209273, it is not showing up in the break bulk page. We were trying to add it to the load list on voyage Vega Luna 166SB but we couldn’t. I suspect that the break bulk page only shows DR that were created as break bulk, if that’s the case how can we add boats and vehicles to the load list. Is it possible to add this feature to the DR page so we can filter the DRs sailing in a voyage that have no stuffing movement?

Error in Gate Movements and possibly other reports I ran a gate out full report for the period September 1 to November 30 2019. Some of the container numbers which were indeed gated out full are now linked to a BPI number which is scheduled to arrive next week. An example of a number BSIU3192990. I should be able to pull the correct information on this container number by making it unique. It is made unique by linking it to a BPI number. In the example BPI 2019121230 is yet to arrive at the Terminal.

Transfer Cargo to a Different Warehouse At the port we basically have two warehouses where one is one commercial cargo and the other for non-commercial cargo. In theory all of the cargo is stripped or discharged a total Shed 4 and then the non-commercial cargo is transferred to shed 2. Under 'Cargo', 'Breakbulk', is it possible to have one of the batch actions as transfer cargo.

Hey Guys, Recently our package codes table was updated, and we wanted to know how to go about adding the new package codes. Is there a method to add the package codes ourselves, or failing that, is it possible for us to send an excel document with our current list of package codes for you to add?

I am auditing deliveries from the slag vessel FSLV1905. Looking at the Audit Log of that cargo, I see a duplicate delivery, see move #20 and #21, both of which occurred at exactly the same time on 9/30/19 at 07:27:18 both showing a 48,000 lb delivery. I then ran the Breakbulk Delivery report to look at 9/30. I only see one delivery on 9/30 at 07:27:18, which is here as ID 1323961. Was this another instance of double clicking? Also with this vessel, looking at the cargo page, the sum of current inventory + delivered inventory = 97,047,400, which differs from the 97,002,400 that we actually discharged through the Tally screen. Please advise your findings.

Tamizhselvi T, From my understanding of below correspondence it appears that you are not receiving some of the EDIs generated by Octopi. I took some containers from below sample and it shows that the EDI messages for these containers were sent successfully. Please take a look at attached images. I’m adding the Octopi support team in copy to see why you are not receiving those messages. If the issue lies elsewhere please let me know so we can continue trying to identify the problem.

Sebastien, Looking at a Reunion Bay stock transfer that occurred twice within one second of each other. Please take a look at ID 3208327 and 3208328. Same situation with ID’s 3475878 and 3475879, 3641569 and 364156970 and 3482373 and 3482374. Could this have been caused by an internet drop? THanks, Jim James W.

Luz, My issue wasn’t the circle vs oval for the sequence. My issue was the size of the square that lists all the info inside.

Hello, Since day one we’ve always adjusted the margins to .25 for all sides, it’s also always cut off like below, but the box size for the containers didn’t change. Now, today printing isn’t the same. I did adjust margins some more but that changes nothing for the box size. Again, like last weeks printing issues this has to be something that’s just changed? **Thanks,** ![cid:image001.png@01D2F4CB.003E5870](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/ONrSgwELa75g7OMn4f1r69Kb7/?name=image003.png) **Shannon MINER** **Marine Superintendent, OPS** ** ** **APL (America) LLC** Direct line: 907.581.8601 Cell: 907.359.3805 1125 East Point Road Dutch Harbor, AK 99692 **www.apl.com** ![cid:image002.png@01D3A0FC.95F4FDA0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/C6nTnFLZpjFlFK8X796DdPrun/?name=image004.png) ![cid:image003.png@01D3A0FC.95F4FDA0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/sdo69nw8YjQAupbYmVKE5W9AH/?name=image005.png) ![cid:image004.png@01D3A0FC.95F4FDA0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/0xXAbeblu0X9qGrmQ3X0GywE0/?name=image006.png) ![cid:image005.png@01D3A0FC.95F4FDA0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/hhkDchOQq1RIPsMvHxsaaYzF3/?name=image007.png) ![cid:image006.jpg@01D3A0FC.95F4FDA0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/UusppWRngzAe0NqVhpfJbVcEO/?name=image008.jpg) ![cid:image001.jpg@01D41F6D.CA540FB0](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/gwzO60ySTmlSbKNqLHHe22TCk/?name=image009.jpg) ![Description : cid:image002.png@01D2F0C6.6078DC50](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/z5p22AM5mxJ7LZGDdUtWpHW2N/?name=image010.png) ![cid:image003.png@01D2F4CB.003E5870](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/v7grOAsV0SgIXVYj9bFbV2etW/?name=image011.png) ![2018 Awards Email Signature Banner](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/gbiQiMuOwFKm5tvOq1pLmtoIF/?name=image012.jpg) _ _ _This message is Intended for the recipient(s) named above._ _It may contain confidential or privileged information. _ _If you are not the ntended recipient, please notify the_ _sender immediately by repl ying to this message and then_ _delete it from your system.

No. Sometimes the containers came late at night and are loaded before they are in gated. That's the reason why tally men put them in the special lifts.

Hi: Can we send the interchange vouchers directly to the driver instead of the trucking company? We are trying to go paperless and almost all the trucking companies have emails in Octopi but a lot of drivers still request the voucher. Yesterday a driver had an accident when trying to get the printed voucher. I suggest having an email field on the driver page and a button on the truck visit page (close to the print button) to send email voucher to the driver if requested. That way we can use this feature just for the one who ask. Or do it automatically if the driver have an email and it is not expensive for Octopi. Regards,

Thanks for the reply Anna. Many clients have a octopi username and use it to follow their BLs. Instead of calling the accounting department to ask for their invoice amount they are asking if there’s the possibility for them to visualize their invoice on octopi. It would save them time and render their ops more efficient.

Good afternoon, team. Please check report informing, the information contained does not match the reality of the worked vessel. https://octopi.co/octopi-reports/vessel_report Information shown is not clear for understanding. The data loading and unloading, full and empty, lack of dry information. For example, in the empty Reefer information, the system will update when units are entering the terminal, ideally "empty" would have another name ("Outside terminal"), for faster understanding. We need this report to have the DRY container information, so all the information would be complete. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/voyages/210352

Good morning team, As you know, in order for empty containers to gate out of the terminal the client needs an Export Release that is entered at the time of the pickup interchange. After creating the booking and printing the pickup Voucher, we have to manually write the export release number on the voucher. Is it possible to add an Export Release number field to the booking section so that the pickup vouchers can be printed with the export release number?

This is a follow-up to your previous request #2724 "Electricity and Storage issues" Octopi Team, It is very important to solve for us the problem of the number of days displayed on the storage pro forma. The clients complain a lot. They receive a proforma who has more days than the actual days spent at the terminal. Current calculation mode based on the proforma below: TEU * WHOLE DAY * TARIFF. 2 TEU * 60 WHOLE DAY * $5 = 2*60*5 = 120*5=$600.00 Now the correct way, the one we had before and we want now: TEU * TARIFF * WHOLE DAY. 2 TEU * $5 * WHOLE DAY= 2*5*60 = 10*60=$600.00 Thank you in advance to make the necessary.

The tariff is $5 / TEU / Whole Day. $5 * 2 TEU * 1 Whole Day => $10. We're exploring ways to make it more obvious how the charges were calculated on the invoice. Regards, Jeff Octopi Support (Octopi) Sep 5, 5:14 PM EDT Yves, We have put in a fix so that this no longer happens. We apologize for introducing this bug recently. We have found that there were 73 invoices affected which you can find in the file attached below called invoices-for-dry-containers-with-reefer-storage-charges.csv. Do you want us to edit these invoices so that we remove the bad line items from these invoices in Octopi? In addition, we've verified that the reverse scenario did not happen, charging dry storage for reefer containers and we found no cases of this happening. Please let us know how you want us to proceed with these 73 invoices with the error?

Good afternoon dear Cetus Lab Team, We are figuring out a little issue with vessel plan module. It allows 2 or 3 containers located in a same room/cell. For example: “ if we consider the bay 05(06)07. We can place on 40’ container 060206, and another 20’ container 050206 and another 20’ container 070206 .” Or the 40’ is located in, or 2 other 20’ located in. a message “error” should display if we try to make it wrong. The same message display for any wrong position, like placing a 40’ in a bay starting by an impair number or 20’ in a bay starting by pair number; more, place any container in a no configured slot. We would like also to be able to have a PDF plan after download and/or upload an edi file, because some agencies usually forget to submit it to us. Thanks in advance !

Bom dia, time. Por gentileza, verificar caso que já foi informado em reunião sobre a dispositivo "booking update - de acordo com load list". Visto que deve ser acionado essa ferramente no "gate in" e realizar o ajuste de booking e destino. Lembrando que não está inserindo os dados do exportador no relatorio de "full export at terminal". Neste caso especifico, temos o container GESU9367244 que deveria embarcar com destino Esalg de acordo com load list, porém encontra-se com destino Nlrtm de acordo com "Gate in". ----- Good morning, team. Please check if you have already been informed in a meeting about the device "booking update - according to load list". Since this tool must be triggered in the gate in and perform the booking and destination adjustment. Remembering that you are not entering the exporter data in the "full export at terminal" report. In this specific case, we have the container GESU9367244 which should ship to destination Esalg according to load list, but is to destination Nlrtm according to "Gate in". 1- Creation or activation of "other" movement according to load list before gate in; 2- booking the gate in with destination Nlrtm; 3- Load list container with destination Esalg. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/octopi-reports/cargo_after_voyage_cut_off_time?utf8=%E2%9C%93&options%5Bvoyage_id%5D=210023&button=

Can you please go back in time and check if this unit was created as KingOcean or Crowley? I suspect the superuser was changing that manually, but I would like to confirm if the manifest or insert movements are creating these units as Crowley ones. We are trying to process manifests with the owner tag, but I'm not 100% aware of how is this working. Crowley's units don't send EDI; the confusion is that King Ocean shipping line move some Crowley units and we want the EDI messages, but we also want to know when the box belongs to Crowley. I think Octopi does not have an owner field. Please let us know what you suggest for this matter. Regards,

Stripping Tallies The stripping Tallies has active, pending, completed and closed. The closed Tallies are used similar to an audit function where the port clerk reconciles with the SAB cler. Is it possible to have a report that gives who closes the tally. The report should be able to be generated over a date range with several filters. The filters should include the vessel, the clerk who closes the tally and other filters that may be useful. You may want to consider a report which may show containers that are active, pending, completed and closed. This may end up being the same report and used filters. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/stripping_tallies

Jeff, It pulled a rebar storage tariff that only applies when no specific consignee is selected. That tariff,https://octopi.co/tariffs/805 is only for storage, not breakbulk delivery (truck loading). We do have a few tariff rates set up for truck loading, but those are triggered by a breakbulk unload movement. Essentially we are invoicing all of the truck loading in advance, as soon as the ship is completed. Seehttps://octopi.co/tariffs/934 for an example. Breakbulk storage, for any of the tariffs we have entered, should only run on the first of every month. Luc and Anna and I have been working on this, and ran a test on 8/1. Other examples date back as far as July 8, and include: 728500, 728044, 728013, 725884. Since we have no Breakbulk Delivery tariffs, none of these should have invoiced. Thanks, Jim

I ran the Tally Report for the Ikan Leban to verify the manual OS&D that we prepared. The Tally Report shows a total of five bundles short, which Octopi should show as still on the vessel on the Tally page. The Tally shows no cargo left to discharge. I verified counts in Cargo/Breakbulk for this vessel. There were no shortages in L546 or L5. We did note a shortage of one bundle L446 #4-40-GR60, which appears to have been found. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/tallies/5898/reports

Hi: We are having some problem finding the gensets in Octopi due to they were created via EDI with zeros filling the 6 digit serial number. The physical genset has number G338 so users tend to search for that but GDZ sent the EDI with extra zeros. I already suggested to our users to only search for the numbers. Below image is an example of that. Can you please help us finding and merging all the gensets with this problem? Any idea for how to avoid this?

Dear Support Team, Please be informed that after doing the stuffing for the containers that already linked to bookings, we didn’t find those containers in the cargo lines under the booking. Please check below screen shots ![image1.png](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/d7KFrO2uLqXAV4dPDaWJcSm0O/?name=image1.png) ![image2.png](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/LBjQlLld2fPgGHC1mNsVTBNtw/?name=image2.png) ![image3.png](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/Wjc0IqHKb009Z7f3vLIIfEMqe/?name=image3.png) We don’t know why you keep changing processes, also we were able before to gate in containers from a terminal to terminal after being stuffed. Also before all captured photos in the damaged report were being saved in the report but now you save only the last photo. These changes have interrupted our process in Octopi and I did raise two previous tickets for it but didn’t receive a convening reply. For the gate in issue we tried to use the transfer in& out option but it asks for a booking which is not the case for transfer out empty container after being stripped from import yard to empty yard. Appreciate your prompt feedback or having a phone call during this week to discuss these critical changes urgently.

Hey Guys, We have discovered a few bills of lading that didn’t have a FAS hold applied. After conducting our investigation, we found that when breakbulk cargo is broken down into sections on board a vessel and discharged in segments this results in the bill of lading losing the FAS hold. Kindly see below for details to locate the bills of lading: BPI Number: 2019070794 BOL Numbers: AB30-03, AB30-17, AB30-20 Please let us know if there is anything you can do to assist.

Hi Anna: Yes, that is our envision. You guys gave us the advice of using the attachment as a temporary solution. The problem with this approach is that it is not easy to relate the image with the actual movement; we need to check the times to find the right attachment. Users need extra navigation to add pictures so we would like to make that more comfortable for them. By the way, now that I read this to myself, I think it would help if you give us the option to attach files to the movement row (inside the movements tab) instead of the attachment tab. And show the attachments in their movements in modal form, so we don't need to download the file. I hope this help.

Hi: Equipment Master (EM) created booking 10597722 for empties and associated it with the 15 containers manually. Octopi had a booking for these units due to the gate in was done with a running booking. Because of this the EDI messages for the loading movements were not send. If we have container “A” with booking “AB” and then we create booking “BB” and associate it with container “A” the old relation must be broken (A – AB=> A—BB ).

Reports Generated I believe that all of the reports need to be looked at. I am trying to generate a report which gives the Gate in or Gate out movements for containers but some of the data is not being returned correctly. If a container arrives on different voyages the data would be incorrect. For example, of a container arrived in January 2019 and again in June 2019, the report would show the last discharged date as June 2019 but the moved at date would be when the container was first gated in or out when it arrived on the voyage in January 2019. We should be able to get information for each individual voyage that the container arrived on. A container would not arrive on the same voyage (BPI number) more than once. Hence, the BPI number with the container number should be unique to a specific voyage. I believe that other reports would have similar issues. Please fix as a matter of urgency. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/octopi-reports/gate_movements?utf8=%E2%9C%93&options%5Bterminal_ids%5D%5B%5D=27&options%5Bmovement_type%5D=5&options%5Bstatus%5D=1&options%5Bdestination_type%5D=&options%5Bshipping_line_ids%5D%5B%5D=&options%5Bgate%5D=26&options%5Btruck_ids%5D%5B%5D=&options%5Btruck_driver_ids%5D%5B%5D=&options%5Btrucking_company_id%5D=&options%5Bstart_date%5D=2019-01-01+12%3A00+AM&options%5Bend_date%5D=2019-01-31+11%3A59+PM&button=

Hi: After some feedback from the clerks, we would like to request a small but essential change during the interchanges for reefers. During the interchange, the clerk has to enter the booking, the setpoint temperature, and the return and supply values. Right now, they have to check the booking page to see the booked temperature and compare it with the current temperature to avoid problems. Is it possible to show the booked temperature (as a read-only field) once they entered the booking and select the line item?

On this subject, I believe that planned shifting as the name suggests, refers to shifting that has been planned. What we require is that at the point of shifting a container, it is registered by the tally clerk without having to do any additional modifications. For instance, if there was some that said cell to quay that count one move and then quay to cell that counts thr other move, would work for us. However, I will see how what you suggest works.

Shifters On the voyage detailed report and TDR, a Cell to Quay To Cell (restow) shifting now counts for 2 crane moves. I have noticed that a change has been made with respect to shifted ashore containers. This change would have an impact on Barbadoa Port Inc. that may need to be rectified. We work with differnt shifts and with differnt cranes and would like to know in which shifts and with which crane all containers are handled. I do not believe that the new change would facilitate this. With the change the container is entered once but the moves are counted twice. What happens when a restow container comes off in one shift and then is loaded in another one or what happens when a container is discharged with one crane but is loaded with another crane? Please respond as soon as possible since this affects our data. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/changelog/index

This can not be handled as a gate move, it is an internal move. Please let us know how can we solve the problem. Best Regards,

Hi: Is very nice to have multiple dashboards. Can you please consider to add here more user information? EX: Number of interchanges Number of truck visits Number of truck registration Number of tally entries I think is a good idea to know how many entries are doing the users.

Bom dia, time. Por gentileza verificar caso abaixo: Temos a unidade cgmu9372824, onde foi realizado o GATE OUT, porem foi permitido a informação de (container repair)depois da saída, vemos que seria inlogico este movimento já que a unidade não se encontra no terminal, nosso problema é que o sistema lançou "retorno" ao terminal quando fizeram essa atualização(container repair)... o ideal que não seja permitido está atualização, pois a unidade não se encontra no porto e sim com o cliente. A problemática que a unidade cgmu9372824, ttnu8472640, cgmu6539570, consta no inventario, onde não deveria, pois encontra-se com o cliente. Não sabemos se tem mais unidades que estejam nesta situação, precisamos que seja corrigido. ------------------ Enviado de: https://octopi.co/

If no information is sent in the Hazmat section, it is considered non-hazardous and therefore attempts to find a sequence in the booking that matches (in this case non-haz). The 322 EDI message is a different format but yes, if the equipment is sent with the correct booking sequence number as described in previous email (for example N9*SQ*150~ for sequence 150), it would not have to “guess” the booking sequence to “link” to. The D/R Jason file does contains the booking line item, but not the correct one (at least the sample on this message). Our sequence numbers typically begin at 100 and increment by 100. However because insertions are allowed, you can certainly find any sequence number in between. Very doubtful, if not impossible for a booking sequence to ever be 1 however. For any of this to work, we would have to receive the actual sequence number from our booking table. This means it must be sent in our message 301 to Octopi, and they must find a way to store it somehow to be able to send it back to us on the 322 and JSON D/R message. I thought this was already in place, however I just checked with JC and it is NOT currently “ON” and therefore NOT being generated on the 301 to Octopi. This is a setting we can turn on at any time and begin sending the actual booking sequence in the 301 message, however since it affects (or could affect) Octopi in reading the 301 message, we must wait for them to give the OK before we can turn this feature “ON” in order to avoid any errors or mishaps. Once Octopi confirms that they can read this segment, or at least confirm that it will not generate an error, please let us know and we will turn it “ON” and start sending the sequence. I will wait for your approval to turn this “ON”. Both our 322 and JSON readers already look for these booking sequence segment and reads them accordingly, so they should be ready from our end.

Yordan, With regards to Hazmat, we use the hazmat information in the message to determine if the line as hazardous or not and therefore use this to find a corresponding sequence (haz or non-haz) in booking. If no information is sent in the Hazmat section, it is considered non-hazardous and therefore attempts to find a sequence in the booking that matches (in this case non-haz). The 322 EDI message is a different format but yes, if the equipment is sent with the correct booking sequence number as described in previous email (for example N9*SQ*150~ for sequence 150), it would not have to “guess” the booking sequence to “link” to.

Hi Guys, Yes, we can manually place a hold on the cargo when creating a BOL record. Note however, that many of our manifests have over 70 Bills of Lading, so we will need to call the API 70 (or more) times for a single manifest. As discussed with Luc, this approach will create a noticeable (and possibly undesirable) delay for users registering a manifest in our portal. This doesn't address manually created B/Ls though. For example, if we receive a manifest with 10 B/Ls, and we subsequently receive an amendment by addition for another 2 B/Ls, we have to log into Octopi to enter those B/Ls manually. Can the FAS hold be automatically put in effect for B/Ls created this way?

Hi: Can you please review what’s happening here? See attached image. Booking 10557206 is created twice in Octopi for different shipping lines. Crowley units discharged at the terminals are manifested with King Ocean as the shipping line, then these units are been out gated with a booking that belongs to King Ocean. For some reason these bookings are tied to Crowley and King Ocean as well, and when the users try to gate out the units an error show up. The Superuser at Host was changing the shipping line to Crowley as a solution but this is not working due to some EDI messages fail. A new user at Host called me asking for support so I just realize the issue. We are trying (on another ticket) to make GDZ let Octopi know the owner of the containers inside the manifests xml files. We need Octopi to review the manifest reader and consider how the container should be associated with the shipping line to prevent any error at the gate out time. We also need Octopi to review why a booking can be created twice for two different shipping lines. Please let us know how can we handle this situation.

Hi Guys, We have made the necessary changes to our software to release the FAS hold (via the Bill of Lading Holds API) when all applicable charges are paid. 1. Can you automatically set the FAS hold on new Bills of Lading when we push them from our portal to Octopi? 2. Can you set the FAS hold when new B/Ls are manually created in Octopi (e.g. an amendment to an existing manifest)? The hold should only be in place when bill_of_lading.type_of_contract = "FAS".

The reefer monitoring has been affected by this; the user can not monitor the reefer because the container is not at the terminal. For you guys, this sounds very positive, but for the reefer mechanic not. They are spending too much time calling someone to fix the problem so they can finally register the monitoring. I want to suggest something: Can the reefer mechanic do the Plug-In for reefers that are not in the terminal? Can the reefer mechanic confirm the seal if the container has no Gate In Movement? Can the system do an automatic Gate In 10 min before the Plug-In? (so the billing don't get affected) Can the system send emails or create a queue with the containers that need to be weighted? (if the unit is plug-in with no gate in) I think that by doing this, the reefer users will be more independent, and the system will help them work fine even if the gate users are not doing so. Also the terminals won't need to check the containers (at least the reefers) that came late at night because they were plugged in (Notice the reefer mechanic stay longer than the gate user).

Hi: The main reason for this email is that even if we change the shipping line for a container the movements are not getting related to the right shipping line. In the BL MOIPEV01491 you can see there are 8 containers that were associated to KO as shipping line due to they were manifested in the XML file. I had to edited them to Dole as the shipping line but the USDA inspection moves are not visible now. Also if this happens for a lot of units we have to go one by one and change the shipping line, which can be done easily by editing the shipping line for the whole BL. I’m aware of the way we should do it. I’ll wait for GDZ and for a better example to talk about the owner tag.

I think we have talk about this already so you probably have a ticket. Are you allowed to read this tag ? Is it possible for us to edit the shipping line for a BL? Sometimes a BL have multiple containers and we have to go one by one and manually change them. We also noticed today that some of these units were USDA inspected while KOSL was the shipping line, then I edited the shipping line and now the stuffing & stripping report is not showing them under Dole.

Crane Productivity In the dashboard it seems that the net productivity stops calculating correct when a tally is completed. it updates correctly only when both tallies are completed. With the page attached, G1 net productivity is better than the overall productivity for the vessel. Since there is only one crane being used, I believe that both productivity figures should be the same. Also at BPI, we take out time for the hatch covers and gear boxes. We would like for the productivity figures be only for containers handled. So two measures can be given, containers only and then include all moves as is done now. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/voyages/209022

Hi Anna It is getting close to accurate. The report also has to take into consideration the usage, it seems. For example if there was a container that was for unstuffing, and then it was gated out and returned full, it is showing on the report.

Hi Carlos: In this case the container is been inspected at Sun Terminals- South as an internal movement (never leave the terminal for inspection) In my opinion this should not be handle as a gate move unless we define a Q5 segment for internal moves.

Hello All, We need ability to bill Dockage to the shipline. Our rates are based on Net Registered Tonnage, which I see a field for Net Tons in the Admin> Vessel details page. The way dockage works is as follows: Rate is $0.38 per Net Registered Ton per day, or fraction thereof. This could be pulled from the Net Tons in the vessel details, and using Actual Time of Berth, and Actual Time of Berth Departure. Note that we don’t pro-rate dockage. Each calendar day the vessel is alongside for any portion of the day, they get billed for the entire day. For barges only, the rate is $0.75 per lineal foot of length. Perhaps the billing can look to the type of vessel to decide which method to use. In either case, there is a $1,400 per day minimum charge. Thanks, Jim James W. Bailey, II, ASP Senior Manager, Safety & Equipment Port Contractors Management, LLC (804)-640-6816

I did a little research today and noticed what happened but I’m not sure how it happened. Anyways, Al was able to transfer 57 bundles of PR324 rebar to Desco’s account. However, when he tried to transfer more, all he could find was the 57 transferred to Desco and not anymore in the importer’s account (Stamford). Not sure what happened, and needing to get these transfers done, I transferred 1 bundle back to Stamford then edited the numbers so that they properly reflected what Stamford should have in its account. Shortly after, I had a hunch and looked on the tallies page and noticed that the tallies page was no longer “completed” and saw that the other 250 bundles of PR324 rebar was on the “to be discharged” column and no longer in the completed tally column. Obviously this is very weird as 1) we are not sure how this happened, and 2) in order for Al to have transferred the 57 bundles over to Desco, the original amount of 307 bundles of PR324 rebar would have had to been discharged on the tallies page in order for Al to access it. Could you look into this? Not sure if this was a simple accidental user error or if it’s a more serious matter of Octopi messing up. Thank you guys, and let me know if you have any questions or if I can help some way. Regards, Rich

Reefer Plugin Report- Destination Code Please add the Destination Code as a filter and to the report for the Reefer Plugin Report.

Hi again: A user asked me the following question: How do we record when the reefer is doing defrost? Defrost is a process the reefer does to eliminate the ice on the evaporator so the air can flow. When this happens, the temperature display can show high values, but the user can see that the reefer is draining water. I told them to record whatever was on the screen, but Octopi is marking the temperature fields as red, I think because of the considerable difference in values. What can we do? Is it possible to add a column called "Doing Defrost" with a checkbox? Please let us know what we can do? Regards,

These moves are been done on chassis with no genset so the clerks can’t see the temperature. Your suggestion is exactly what I’m doing but I would like a better solution.

Hi: The terminals are having some problems with the monitoring. I'll explain so you can help us. 1. If the during the monitoring a reefer is received at the same terminal it has to be added manually. I suspect Octopi is reading the list once when the monitoring starts. Can Octopi add them automatically? Notice that monitoring can take about an hour. 2. The monitoring report is showing all the reefers that were on the first list. Can Octopi only show the reefers that are monitored? Now we have to filter the ones with "Blank" values on the "Supply" column. 3. The reefers that came through Mid Port are getting transferred to the other Terminals on some occasions "OFF", so the clerks are not registering the temperature during the transfers. When this happens, the reefer doesn't show up in the monitoring list and can't be added manually due to it is "OFF". How should we handle these cases? We are not recording plugs in and out currently. Is this the only way or you can help us?

Tally Verification the Tally Verification is working well and we have had some time working so as to provide some additional feedback. We are presently working the system with container vessels only. 1. at times after loading a container and it has been verified by the SAB clerk, the port may want to undo the loading. When this is done, the container is also removed from the Tally Verification and all information entered by the SAB clerk is lost. Also, the SAB would have already verified the container and he would believe that his job is finished. I am proposing that if after a container has been verified and it is undone by the port, the tally verification data should not be modified. Containers and cargo should be removed from the tally verification independent of discharge and load tallies. 2. Since there is a report for Tally Verification, this same report should be able to be seen by the agent for the vessel by going into the Reports tab and entering the BPI number. I know that we are looking for a way to send an automated email to the agent for the vessel after the tally verification has been completed (this would no longer be required). The added benefit is that the agent would be able to see the progress of the tallying at any stage of the working of the vessel. At present the port is downloading the file and sending it the the respective agents for the vessel. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/tally_verifications/tally/5618

Hi: To solve the problem we have with the stuffed containers and the bookings, the new software just added to the booking line item a column for the stuffed container. Let me explain: If a booking is made with an LCL line item, our new software will add a column to record the container in which the DR is stuffed. This will help us know in which container is every DR and will allow us to use the LCL booking to move the container without having to modify the booking at all. To test this feature, we will need Octopi to send us a JSON file with the stuffing information. Our proposal is as follows: DR JSON: { "location_id":"1151", "dock_receipt_number":"190501929", "booking_number":"10569011", "shipper_name":"DAGIM LOGISTICS & SERVICES INC", "truck":{"license_plate":null,"company_name":null}, "cargoes":[ {"cargo_type":"breakbulk","booking_line_item_number":1,"dimension_unit":"inches","height":8.0,"length":7.0,"width":8.0,"weight_unit":"lb","weight":"","quantity":1.0,"description":"Half gallon of paint","hazmat_codes":[],"extras":{}}, {"cargo_type":"breakbulk","booking_line_item_number":1,"dimension_unit":"inches","height":26.0,"length":21.0,"width":15.0,"weight_unit":"lb","weight":"","quantity":1.0,"description":"Crate","hazmat_codes":[],"extras":{}}, {"cargo_type":"breakbulk","booking_line_item_number":1,"dimension_unit":"inches","height":7.0,"length":192.0,"width":11.0,"weight_unit":"lb","weight":"","quantity":1.0,"description":"Crate","hazmat_codes":[],"extras":{}}, {"cargo_type":"breakbulk","booking_line_item_number":1,"dimension_unit":"inches","height":31.0,"length":652.0,"width":102.0,"weight_unit":"lb","weight":10925.999999999998,"quantity":1.0,"description":"BEAM","hazmat_codes":[],"extras":{}} ] } Stuffing JSON 1: { "location_id": "1151" "container_number": "KOSU1234567", "seal": "KOSL123456", "cargoes ": [ {" dock_receipt_number ": 190501929, "cargo_id": 1}, {" dock_receipt_number ": 190501929, "cargo_id": 2} ], "over_width": "yes", "over_height": "no", "over_length": "n/a", "stuffed_by": "username", "stuffed_at": "date time value" } Stuffing JSON 2: { "location_id": "1151" "container_number": "KOSU7654321", "seal": "KOSL654321", "cargoes ": [ {" dock_receipt_number ": 190501929, "cargo_id": 3}, {" dock_receipt_number ": 190501929, "cargo_id": 4} ], "over_width": "yes", "over_height": "no", "over_length": "n/a", "stuffed_by": "username", "stuffed_at": "date time value" } Our system will have the DRs and their bookings so any future movement of the stuffed container can be sent with any of the bookings used for the DRs entries. Notice we won't ask for a booking during the stuffing process, so we suggest to remove or make not required the booking field in the stuffing form you already have to avoid confusion due to the user doing the stuffing don't know what booking should be used. A DR can have multiple lines so please consider to add a "cargo_id" to identify the cargo if a DR gets split into different containers and allow users to print different voucher for each cargo.

For full stripping I think we can send to GDZ a new EDI (GATE IN) with a special code like we do with empty repo so GDZ can update the history saying is empty now. Make sense?

Hey Guys, Al came across an issue in Ocopi yesterday while I was out of the office. I did a little research today and noticed what happened but I’m not sure how it happened. Anyways, Al was able to transfer 57 bundles of PR324 rebar to Desco’s account. However, when he tried to transfer more, all he could find was the 57 transferred to Desco and not anymore in the importer’s account (Stamford). Not sure what happened, and needing to get these transfers done, I transferred 1 bundle back to Stamford then edited the numbers so that they properly reflected what Stamford should have in its account. Shortly after, I had a hunch and looked on the tallies page and noticed that the tallies page was no longer “completed” and saw that the other 250 bundles of PR324 rebar was on the “to be discharged” column and no longer in the completed tally column. Obviously this is very weird as 1) we are not sure how this happened, and 2) in order for Al to have transferred the 57 bundles over to Desco, the original amount of 307 bundles of PR324 rebar would have had to been discharged on the tallies page in order for Al to access it. Could you look into this? Not sure if this was a simple accidental user error or if it’s a more serious matter of Octopi messing up. Thank you guys, and let me know if you have any questions or if I can help some way. Regards, Rich

Hi Luciano It seems that the problem is not a deletion. The clerk has informed that when discharging that somehow the tallies go to a different consignee and then they would undo the discharge to rectify the problem. This is where the issue occurs. We have a similar issue this morning with the discharge tallies again. https://octopi.co/tallies/5410 **Sheldon Layne** Asst.

Tally Verification Good morning I am seeing a minor issue that can crop up with the tally verification for the loading of containers. We try to keep the tallies as real time as possible and hence, the container is only tallied when it is on the spreader of the crane and not when the container is brought down to the vessel. The reason is clear. Sometimes the containers are by the vessel and then there is a crane malfunction, a change in shift, or other delays in loading. The tally clerk for the Tally Verification would need time to record the seals in Octopi. However, the system is designed so that the tally clerk can only verify the container after it has been tallied by the cargo supervisor. This is good in theory but as mentioned, a little problematic in practice. Is it possible that for the tally verification for loading, that the container can be verified when it is on the loading list. So that would mean, that the container can be verified for specific numbers that would be placed on the loading or after the container has been sent into the queue and ends up on the loading list. If the above is done, we would still be able to tally real time and the SAB clerks would be able to put in their information. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/tallies

Container Empty Quota Good morning Every year, we look at the containers that were discharged from vessels in order to arrive at the quota that we would allow for each line to store empty containers in the port free, after which, storage charges would apply. I am looking for a report that can give me the containers discharged by line and be delivery type. I use the delivery type remove the full containers are transshipped from vessel to vessel. We include cruise ship stores as transshipment but i would need to separate them from the regular transshipment as just mentioned. The report in movements can be used but the delivery type would need to be added so that i can filter out the transshipment and then used the other data to come up with the necessary calculation. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/octopi-reports/vessel_movements?utf8=%E2%9C%93&options%5Bstart_datetime%5D=2018-04-01+12%3A01+AM&options%5Bend_datetime%5D=2019-02-28+11%3A59+PM&options%5Bmovement_type%5D=8&options%5Bshipping_line_ids%5D%5B%5D=&options%5Bshipping_line_ids%5D%5B%5D=127&options%5Bclerk_id%5D=&button=

Bom dia, Time. Devido ao tempo que estamos tendo aqui no terminal, nos analisamos os seguinte casos no sistema sobre as anomalias e possiveis ideias para melhoramento do sistema. 1ºCaso: Devido a erro encontrado no arquivo arrival baplie de unidades cheias para descarga...e eliminar a anomalia de lacre... sugerimos a seguinte interpretação para o Octopi, no qual o mesmo já indentifica as unidades cheias de importação do navio. Se for possivel realizar a solicitação, achamos interessante um aviso quando depois de realizar o unloading... pedindo a informação do lacre quando tiver feito o unloading. Exemplo: Possui lacre? Caso a responta seja com sim, o sistema solicita o lançamento do lacre e o sistema confirma o status de cheio. Caso responda com não, o sistema não solicita o lançamento do lacre e o sistema confirma o status de empty. 2ºCaso: Quando as unidades cheias estiverem no terminal, permanece com as anomalias de floating container e invalid current location para assim ser identificado o erro e corrigi-lo, caso o container tenha sido embarcado... Sugerimos que o sistema faça "correção desta duas anomalias", retirando do report a anomalies type. Caso seja possivel esse ajuste o sistema com indicara que temos area livre no yard para poder colocar outra unidade no local, sem provocar outra anomalia. --------- Good morning. Due to the time we are having here in the terminal, we analyze the following cases in the system about the anomalies and possible ideas for improving the system. 1Case: Due to an error found in the arrival baplie file of filled units for unloading ... and to eliminate the sealing anomaly ... we suggest the following interpretation for Octopi, in which it already indicates the full import units of the ship. If it is possible to carry out the request, we find it interesting to notice when after performing the unloading ... asking for the sealing information when you have unloaded. Example: Does it have sealing? If the answer is yes, the system requests the sealing to be released and the system confirms the status of full. If it responds with no, the system does not request the seal to be released and the system confirms the empty status. 2Case: When the filled units are in the terminal, it remains with the floating container and invalid current location anomalies, so that the error can be identified and corrected if the container has been shipped ... We suggest that the system make "correction of these two anomalies", removing from the report the anomalies type. If this adjustment is possible the system indicated that we have free area in the yard to be able to put another unit in place without causing another anomaly. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/

Gate in Containers Shipped We have the ability to gate in a container that has been loaded to a vessel. I don't know what else can be done with the container. However, if the container has been loaded to a vessel, we should to be able to gate in or gate out unless by admin movements.

I just realized why is this happening. Instead of clicking the edit button on the movement, they are clicking the chassis link and then they edit the chassis thinking this will update the chassis for the movement. We need to solve this by adding the Chassis Edit Permission or just by removing the chassis link from there (which I don't recommend). Please let me know what you guys think about?

Hi: How can we prevent this from happening again? I just review the permissions, there is no way for me to prevent this. In order to be able to record chassis, I have to give them "Chassis: write" permission but doing so give them access to edit the chassis as well. Can we create new permission just to edit chassis so I can remove the access from them? Please let me know if this is possible?
NEUTRAL

6 Feb 2019

Hi: As we can see in the attached image we are having an issue when users edit a movement. When a movement is getting edited instead of change the chassis the container was moved on for the movement, Octopi is editing the chassis number so the chassis disappear from Octopi. Please review the example and let us know when this is solved. I already tried to remove the permission from the users but then I realized we needed back.

Hey Guys, One of our customers needs a report of their inventory for the end of the year 2018 for audit purposes. The problem I am running into is that the Break Bulk Inventory Report supplies material on site up to the current date. Is there a way in Octopi for me to pull up a customer’s material up to a specific date, like 12/31/18? I believe when we first started using Octopi I knew of a way to do so, but now I can’t remember if I am misremembering that or if I simply forget how to do it.

Hi Pedro: We must change that. We are making some changes related to this issue. GDZ will be sending the sequence number for each line item and Octopi should send TIRs with that sequence number. Users should be able to select the empty line items in the booking so the container is associated with the right line. In some cases our booking line item comes with the containers number on it. Let say KO made a booking for 10 specific units, they put the numbers on the description. There is no way for us to associate them now. Please feel free to contact me if more details are needed.

If we were to send you the actual sequence number in the LX record of the booking EDI (for example LX*100, LX*150, LX*250, LX*325 to represent the four line items, instead of LX*1, LX*2, LX*3, LX*4).

Hi Luc: Sebastien and I were discussing an issue that is related to this one. When you are adding cargo to an existing DR Octopi is not asking for the booking line item. Every cargo received by the terminal have to be linked to a booking line item and this relation must be send to GDZ so bookings are synced all the time. I have seen different situations with this problem. I believe email is not a good way to explain this problem, our next meeting should be January 7th so ask me for the details and I will show you some examples looking at both systems. I think it is an Octopi issue selecting the right booking line item and a feature both systems need to agreed, how to communicate the selected booking line item. Happy new year.

Hi Luc Simply put- when we use the completed at time for the pilots, the pilot is seen as boarding the vessel, after the vessel has berth. This gives false information as well as prevent the taxable date from being entered. Octopi gives an error message stating that the pilot cannot board after the vessel has berthed.

Hi: Octopi is allowing us to do a stuffing for a DR that is already stuffed. We can have the same DR stuffed in multiple containers but at least we should warn the user when this happens. I believe this will help to prevent typos. We also need to be able to undo a stuffing completely and to move one DR from one container to another. Keep in mind that right now we can not strip a stuffing we did due to Octopi will try to create a new DR instead of using the already created one.

Voyage Events Types Pilots- Arrival Pilot Boarded is associated with Actual Time Pilot Boarded. It is currently pulling the completed at time. It should pull the started at time. The same as above would apply to Pilots- Depature Pilot Boarded. In both cases, the name of the pilot should also be associated. For both Arrival and Departure, is it possible to have the Service Boats associated? These should be associated with Tugs- Berthing and Tugs- Unberthing. ------------------ Submitted from: https://octopi.co/voyages/206758/load_list

Hi: I believe we need more information in this report. Look at the attached image. The report is giving us the circled in blue data and the one in red is just not reachable on the csv file. Is it possible to add it? I believe having the “From” and “To” values on each movement will help. I know the example is kind of a human error but I have seen myself confused in other example with transfers as well. Having this data on the report will help us to know what to do without checking octopi. Let us know if possible or if you guys think we should do something different.

Hi Yordan, Hope all is well. In the old days, LCL typically wasn’t even booked😊 Kidding aside, as I have said before, we can handle it anyway King Ocean wants. We are developing this for you guys. However the problem is that the booking can have multiple lines (sequences) and even though I know the type of cargo you typically receive is one-to-one, I cannot develop it in that way. Unless the booking sequence is sent in the EDI message (which would be Ideal as there would be no ambiguity, but not sure if possible), the EDI reader has to decide or guess which sequence in the booking to “link” to. When this is done, the application (currently) determines which sequence using the Hazardous indicator. In other words, if the EDI message does not contain any hazmat info, it will look for a line item in the booking that is NOT hazardous and vice versa. Bottom line, as I explained in an earlier message to Josh, we can certainly bring the hazardous information from the booking, that is not any problem at all. However it then becomes even more important to determine which line sequence to link to and therefore which one to bring forward. I know most of the time there is only one line, but I still need to develop the EDI reader as if there can exist more than one sequence in the booking. Theoretically, one could expect a booking for two or more cars right. Again, all this is resolved by receiving the booking sequence on the EDI message, otherwise you need to clearly tell us (written preferably) how to handle these cases where there is ambiguity such as in the D/R below. Please let us know how to move forward with this.

For example “I” is in-gate, “OA” is an out-gate, “UV” is a discharge etc. If instead they send an “A” it is considered a “Damage” message. With regards to the hold, need to think it through and then discuss with Octopi to see how to implement. I’ll get back to you.

Do you know about any code we can add in the EDI so GDZ can record these movements as damaged containers? In Octopi is possible to mark a container as damaged and then mark it as repaired with special records. We also would like to know if is possible to add a manual hold on a container directly in GDZ and if this can be send to Octopi via EDI or any other way? This request came to us directly from King Ocean. We have seen some bad practices there for our users so we would like to hear from you the official way of doing so.

Dear Sebastian, I understand you, but I have to inform you that there is a new process with all Over the road container, the move must be posted by Equipment Control with an ADM so that’s why it is important to block it in system.

Hi: Attached image shows an issue we have every time a driver change the license plate. When this happen the security clerk registers a new truck. And because of that Octopi is having some trucks with the same number and different license plates. Our users use the truck number to identify them so this issue is causing bad data history and confusions. I have been merging them but I’m not aware of how many we have. If merge them is the only solution I would like to have a report or email telling me when this happen. Please advice.

Good morning Luc, We would like to make some changes in the billing of Shipping Lines. So, instead of having a single bill for the Line in which we have Terminal Handling Charge, Shifting, Electricity, ..., etc. Is it possible to generate an invoice for each Item category for the Shipping Lines in question? Be able to generate an invoice for Terminal Handling Charge Import and Export, an invoice for Shifting cell / cell and cell / doc / cell, an invoice for electricity and others. With this change, we will be able to automatically invoice Shipping Lines. This is not the case at the moment, because the Lines want invoices for each category. Thank you for letting us know what you can do. It is very important for us to make these changes. ![](https://support.octopi.co/attachments/token/FDHOVsTA0CNdSJ5i1RuJNUCTj/?name=image003.jpg) Thank you in advance, **Best regards,** ** ** **Yves Courtois** **Revenues Accountant** **Caribbean Port Services (CPS) S.A.** 6, Rte de l’Aéroport, Rue Georges Coles Port au Prince, Haïti **Phone:+509 2815-1350 **M: **+509 4786-7225** **Website: **www.cps.ht

Hi: We have this permission "Bookings: Edit Containers" which is showing the containers tied to a booking with a button to break the relation. We need to split this permission in two. 1 "Bookings: Read Containers" so all the clerks can see the container for that booking. 2 "Bookings: Edit Containers" so specials clerks can modify the relation. Let me know if you can split the permission and I'll apply them to the right roles. I spoke about this with Sebastien and he suggested to me a ticket with details. Regards,

Hi Luc: The way it is now looks fine to me as a report. I would like to suggest something I believe will make it much better and usable as a loading guide. GDZ loading guide (the equivalent report) does not help us to know if the container has a DR on it or if a DR is stuffed on a container, they just show us bookings for the voyage in question with a checkbox to separate DR from containers. In my opinion, we should be able to separate DR from containers in the report (which GDZ does) and we should be able to see the container -- DR relation in both sections (GDZ does not do that). We can have the same booking for the container and the DR, but we can also have one booking for the DR 1 and another booking for the container stuffed with the DR 1. We can talk about if you want but I strongly believe that would make your software more useful. Regards,

Good morning team, We have a list of containers that are flagged as sold or for sale. When creating the manifests the system will not let us put a container if it’s marked as sold or for sale or shipper own, which is perfect. The issue we’ve experienced lately is if an empty manifest is already created 4-5 days in advance and in the meantime one of those containers gets sold, is there a way when clicking the loading button to prompt a message asking to confirm if we want that container to be loaded?

You guys should have a ticket already. Anyways I’ll explain again. When a truck show up at the security with a container pick up they prepare the interchange. In some cases (containers going to XRAY as example) the container is transferred out instead of been interchanged out. If the interchange in the truck visit is not deleted before the transfer is done then securities can not gate out the truck due to an “interchange is pending”. When they called us we used to delete the pending interchange and they were able to gate out the truck. Since few days ago this is not working like that anymore. Now when we delete a non completed interchange due to the container was transferred instead of interchanged, the transfer movement is getting deleted and we have to create an admin movement to update the container history. We need your help with this, let us know what you think is the best solution. We were deleting the pending interchanges as a solution, which is not working anymore.

Good afternoon, please review the following recommendations to better update our ticket for gate moves into/out of Crowley. 1. The clerk doing the back gate entries needs a way to monitor the progress of the entries, similar to in the regular tally they should see remaining and completed containers. The dashboard should have that as well. 2. They must be able to confirm the operation is completed. 3. The NB planners must be able to review the process via the report page or perhaps on the voyage page and mark the operation as closed so the shipping line can receive an email confirmation. (such as for the regular tally) 4. The received from berth units must have a BL, if not they should go to the failed outbound EDIs in Octopi waiting for a BL or a manual correction in GDZ. 5. The sent to berth units must have a Booking, if not they should go to the failed outbound EDIs in Octopi waiting for a Booking or a manual correction in GDZ. Please advise on whether empties with no booking will be going to the queue, or if there is a better solution. 6. We might be able to send a container and receive it back with the same booking (undo). 7. The metadata during the gate move must say the voyage information, the status (full or empty) and seals must be blank by default so users must enter them. 8. If received from berth units are reefers they must have the Temperature (we are testing a feature on GDZ to add a tag with the temperature for NB BLs) 9. All movements have to use “Sun Terminals/Port Everglades” as the trucker in the EDI message. Currently the regular tally has all the information we need, therefore we ask to add a trigger in Octopi when selecting a stevedoring terminal other than Host or Sun Terminals as well as to change the EDI messages and the name of the movements.

Hi Octopi: A clerk by mistake did a transfer in instead of a transfer out and Octopi just let that happen. See attached image. The terminals need to block our users to not receive a container that is already in or send a container that is already out. We know that gate movements check that but transfer are not doing it, humans can make mistake but computers can avoid that. Please help us.

Hi team: Last night Alex called me with an issue during a stripping. Attached are the images he sent me. Let me explain better. We stuffed two DR on a container and for some reason we had to strip the same container, when we tried that we realized that Octopi was asking us for information to create new DRs for the cargo instead of getting the two DRs we already did for those. Notice we filled the form and Octopi did not let us finished due to the VIN were taken already. We need Octopi to review this case and advice how to solve it till Octopi fix the problem.

I just saw today that after you create a DR the cargo is created as a container and we can then declare damages as in a normal container. The problem is that Octopi is giving DR users the option to declare damages during the DR form. If we declared the damages during the creation of the DR the damage is not showed in the vouchers. The other way works but Users are asking if we can have it during the DR. They are already doing double work so please take that into consideration. Hope this help understand where the problem is.

Hi: We the terminals have seen some problems due to securities entered a wrong truck and the clerks did not notice it. Here are some request to stop that in the future: When we are searching in the truck visit page Octopi is checking the keyword is included in the truck number, truck license plate and container number, that's making the search result big in must of the cases. 1- Can we have a select button to let Octopi know what are we searching for so Octopi only check the keyword is included in the truck number or truck license plate or the container number? 2- Can we be redirected to the truck visit page after complete an interchange by clicking the double arrows? Now users have to manually go back to the truck visit. We believe this can help. Notice we already told the users to start using the license plate due to they are unique but for some reason, they don't do it yet. The other solution will be to stop identifying the truck by their numbers. Please let us know your thoughts about. Regards,

Hi Octopi: The reason GDZ required a Booking or a BL is to keep the container history tied to the right Voyage. Is it possible that Octopi start tracking when the voyage change for a container? The idea is: If a container is tied to a Booking (gated out or in with booking) we know the booked voyage and we have to use the same Booking (Voyage) for every single movement till the voyage change. If a container is received with a BL (Discharged) we know the manifested voyage and we have to use the same BL (Voyage) for every single movement till the voyage change. Notice a voyage can change in the below cases: 1. Due to a roll over of a booking, which Octopi is receiving via EDI from GDZ, basically Octopi had a container for booking A and GDZ send an EDI with a new booking B (different voyage) for the same container. 2. Full import container coming back empty, in this case GDZ does not require a booking for the empty gate in after full gate out with BL. We have seen some cases in which Octopi is asking for BL after been in gated with a booking if the container is going to another terminal, which is causing big confusion and troubles syncing the systems. Important: if for some reason Octopi (not manifested discharge, or any weird move) can not detect what to use Booking or BL, then Octopi have to ask the user to enter a Booking or a BL, user have to select which one. Make sense?

Hi: Here is and example of one of the problems with bookings. Someone at Camden changed a booking number for container KOSU4952701 on 6/4/18 at 12:00 pm from 10486054 to 0 (no booking) and Octopi did not update the change via EDI. When this happens GDZ send and EDI letting Octopi know that the container has a new booking in this case no booking. In this case the booking have just one line so there is no problem to read that and update Octopi. The problem is with bookings with multiple lines due to GDZ reply with an EDI confirmation every time they received something but if for some reason Octopi send two containers and one goes to the queue in GDZ, when GDZ reply back Octopi will delete the one in the queue and that’s a problem. A solution for one problem becomes in another problem. With the technologies we are using now will be hard to solve this. We only recommend to stop the use of booking with multiple lines so Octopi and GDZ can understand each other.

Hi: There are some cases in which we need to change a booking for a container, is hard to tell you all the reasons and cases. What we can do is tell you how GDZ have been handling this. As you can see in below image, GDZ have a feature to ask the user the new booking. I understand you have something similar but the difference is that GDZ only allowed us to do this in a TIR (gate move) and you have your feature built in the booking page. The Terminals need that both systems agree in a way to communicate this changes. Let say container A was received with booking B and then the booking was changed from B to C. Both systems need to know that container A is now with booking C and booking B is blank. We have seem some confusion the way is working now so we recommend to review the way both systems handle these changes and the way both systems communicate these changes as well. Right now King Ocean bill based on container history (no booking history). I hope this help.

Hi Sebas: This is important, right now Octopi is saying two container are under that booking this can not happen. If a booking was made for one container for no reason we can have more that one.

Clerks can not enter the hazmat codes. Only a specialist at King Ocean can add or delete hazmat codes in a booking. The codes on the booking should be the ones added to the interchange automatically. If hazmat codes change after we received a container the system have to show that on the container page so when we load the container on the vessel that data is accurate. We have spoke about this already maybe is a misunderstanding. Our users just double check that everything is fine at gate time.

Hi: I have submitted some of these issues already but not sure if I missed something so I want to make a list here for us to review. DR=Dock Receipt below. 1. Damages reported during a DR are not reflect in the voucher. I double check after Octopi told me was solved and it is not. 2. We need to add comments done in a DR to the vouchers. That will help the terminals solve some issues with request new features. 3. Once a damaged is reported, we should be able to see it under the DR. I know there is a report already for that, I just test it and couldn’t see anything. 4. The vouchers and booking description during the DR have to show ports name not only port codes. 5. Once we received a DR if for some reason the costumer came to pick it up we need to send that information to GDZ under the same booking. This is not working fine now, we need your help with this. 6. When users are entering Package Type Code in the tablets they have to scroll a big list to touch the one they need. This must be done by typing some letters and letting the users select the correct value from a short list or typing the code. 7. If we use a tablet to take a picture reporting a damage, it work for the first time, after that it doesn’t work again. You might train IT department (me at least) how to handle this I believe could be similar to the keyboard thing we did. 8. When doing a DR a user is able to use any booking. We need to validate this, only booking with LCL lines can be used for DR. Once they type the booking they have to see the available LCL lines, ports names and voyage. 9. When reporting damages in a DR we must be able to enter more than one picture. 10. When we have a DR with no cargo added but with booking, we can not send that information to King Ocean to avoid confusion. We have to complete the DR before send the information. We have seen users get confused and let some DR with no cargo. This a list of problems I collect from DR users. Please let us know if these can be solved and a timeline.

Hi: Below email is for your information. As you can see for items 3 and 4 we need your help. 3- As we can see in below image this is how they look in the baplie file. The size codes used for breakbulk are only three (4351, 4550, 4590) so once Octopi read an item with one of these size codes we need to add the Dock Receipt number in the tally and users have to be able to search for it and marked it as loaded. Right now even if we added the items manually to the load list users can not search for the DR number in the tally.

Hi: As we planned yesterday I spend some time today with the stevedoring team (in life operation). Here are my thoughts. The main reason for mistakes is that we need to overshipped too much cargo. 1- Containers are not stuffed life, when they go to the tally the system shows error. Solution: Doing the stuffing life. 2- Containers have a weird current location in Octopi. I saw today two tanks that were TRS in GDZ after been in gated in Octopi, the TRS is getting send to Octopi and is affecting the current location so when we are tallying them the systems shows error. Solution: For now we have to edit the current location in Octopi which only admin users have access to. Notice: the TRS is done in GDZ must of the times to on hire the container, if by the time this movement reach Octopi the container was in gated already we will have the problem. 3- Breakbulk cargo. The breakbulk cargo is added to the plan simulating a container number in the baplie file. Octopi is not reading this well. Solution: I have to create a ticket explaining them which codes are unique for breakbulk so they can read that appropriately. Notice is not done yet and can take them some time. 4- Load list life. Due to our load list is life we have to frequently add or delete containers to the current plan causing some container not showing on the tally. Solution: We are testing a feature in Octopi that allow us to upload a baplie file multiple times and create the changes for us automatically. Notice we are still testing that. I also spend some time with the planners today and showed them how to find out most of this issues and how to solve them. We still recommend a training meeting due to this talk was during operation and they couldn’t get it 100 %.

Right now Octopi allow us to create a DR for any booking. Only bookings with LCL line can have a DR. If a user tries to enter a DR in a booking with no LCL lines, it has to be blocked. I understand we had issues because the booking is not well done. In my opinion, if a booking has at least one LCL line then it can have a DR which can have multiple cargo items. Please review the process, King Ocean complaint a lot when that happens. See image.

https://octopi.co/bookings/227059 When we are interchanging a container with a booking like this one (with multiple lines with Temperature) we need to see the temperature in the booking description section in the interchange page and we should see the line item number in Octopi so we can match the container with the right line in the booking. Please add the temperature and the line item number in the booking section. Interchange clerks must be able to see the container tied to a booking in the booking page. Right now I can see that with the feature that allows me the clean the relation booking-container. Everyone else should see that relation and only privileged users can break that relation. We are pushing to eliminate the paper, but we need help with this before that. We need to make sure containers are getting tied to the right line item in the booking. You can call me for a better explanation if needed. Please help.

In my opinion, this is a super important issue. A lot of claims are done just by a +-2 difference in the temperature. GDZ is having problems. If Octopi can give us a good report ASAP, I can tell our team to start using it. Maybe you can give some extra credit for that. I am adding a copy of the report from GDZ so you have an idea what we are using now.

Hi: In this voyage https://octopi.co/voyages/204748 we are discharging some bundles of flat racks. As you can see that is making Octopi shows productivity numbers really high. (they hired superman) In the case of the discharge, the plan has these bundled units in the same stowage cell. Is it possible for Octopi to count these bundled units as one? I was asking Noel and he told me that for productivity statistic is fine to record the bundle of flat racks as one move, but for billing porpuses is an agreement that all parties have to sign, can be per container or per move. So we think is a good idea if you keep track of that, based on the stowage cell you can know if some flat racks are bundled. For productivity, you can count them as one move, and for billing, you can configure them as per move or per container. The tricky part is the loading, as per Noel we usually send them individually, one flat rack per stowage cell. But can be possible to send them bundled in which case we leave that up to you.

These two containers created EDI messages and they failed due to they had no BL. If the overlanded containers are marked as "is restow" and have the shifting movements putting them back in the vessel we don't need to send EDI. If a container is overlanded and for some reason is not restow, then we need to check why this happened and probably have to send EDI. Right now you created the EDI when the tally overland a container, in my opinion, this should be done when the tally is completed. we need to review this process and try to avoid the overlanded, let say they need to overland due to they need to be restow, the tallyman has to make sure all of them are loaded back in the vessel. if the tally is completed and some containers are still overlanded then we create the EDI and put them in the failed queue, but this should not happen.

Hi, Teams: Octopi just released a new version in which we can add and delete items to the plan. This is allowing us to start using Octopi's plan to discharge and load the vessels and say goodbye to the paper plans. Last week Elkin used this version and it worked very well. However, there is one more thing we want to request before start using this feature. We have two cases in which we add positions in the plan for containers without knowing the numbers. 1. Vessel conveniences. We use some flat racks for decking a break bulk, in this case, the planner reserved the position in the plan but the numbers are recorded in the tally during the operation. 2. Empties. We load some empties, they must have a booking. In these case, the booking tells the planner to add some positions for empties but the numbers must come in the booking or are recorded in the tally during operation. Our request is to integrate the current feature of over ship containers with the plan. Let say the planner added 3 positions without numbers for 40HC containers to the plan, only 3 containers (40HC numbers) can be added to the tally, the same we do now with the over ship. This way we can know in real time the numbers for the containers that were added to the plan without numbers once they are tallied and we will always load what the planner puts in the plan. This is the terminal suggestion, please give us your thoughts about.

What we want is Octopi helping the planner. There is a bunch of things they have to do now that can be eliminated, maybe if one of you spend some time with Elkin, planning a vessel, you will understand better. About the HAZMAT changes, there is only one person at King Ocean (a hazmat specialist) allowed to change the hazmat in the bookings. Elkin and Noel strongly believe that Octopi can update the container HazMat information based on booking updates and help the planner showing these changes somehow during the planning. Helping us to automatically detect any issue segregating containers. Let say the planner puts two containers in neighbors cells because they were class 9 but later King Ocean updates the bookings (hazmat) and these two containers need to be separated 4 cells away. This is something that a human can easily fail at but a program tracking these changes won't fail. Giving us an anomaly won't help too much, it is almost the same as receiving the report KO sends us. We know Octopi is smart enough to give us a better solution. Thanks.

Here are some issues we saw in the voyage load list: Can we see the DR number instead of VIN or anything else in the Container number column? (LCL lines) The print button is not working. Current location for DRs (LCL) must show us the flat rack number if it is stuffed already (very important), but the current location of the flat rack have to be used to show the DR in the right tab ("pending arrival" or "arrived at the terminal")

Hi: Sometimes King Ocean receive the documentation for the hazmat after the terminal receives the container. When the terminal is interchanging a container we have to confirm that the container matches the booked information, sometimes we catch the issue at the gate and wait for the solution but sometimes we don't. The planner receives a HAZARDOUS CARGO MANIFEST from King Ocean telling us the final HAZ for each container. King Ocean have to edit the booking to add the HAZ data and then run the report they send to the planner. So at that point, Octopi should have the changes to the bookings already. What we need is to update the container with the booking HAZMAT data so we have the updated data everywhere in Octopi. Right now the planner has to review the containers in this report one by one and make sure they are well segregated to avoid accidents. This is very risky (humans make mistakes). I think Octopi can help us do this automatically.

As you can see in the image this report is considering a DR stuffed in a container as "Pending Arrival" due to the current location is Container instead of Terminal. Can you please do something so when a DR is stuffed it shows in the "arrived at the terminal" based on the current location of the container where the DR is stuffed at.

Also, Zach noted that it would be good to be able to pre-stage a delivery. For instance, when the customer sends us a release order, our checker and lift operator may pull the order and set it aside ready to be loaded onto its truck at a later date. Similarly, it would be good to be able to load an order onto a dropped trailer. For instance, a trucking company may drop off several empty trailers to us. We load at our convenience, and the truck comes back at a later date, signs for the load, hooks up and departs. Thanks, Jim

Luc / Sebastien, I’m sure the time with Sebastien will be productive, and we’ll be able to learn quite a lot more about navigating around in Octopi. For now, just hunting around trying different things. Attached are some initial comments / screen shots.

See the image. When a DR is stuffed in a container and that container is loaded in a vessel we need to update the current location of the DR.

Octopi should validate the container ID, only letters and number are valid. Let me know any change you decide, please.

Could happen that a clerk overshipped a container mistakenly, Octopi should check an overshipped container is not on the tally before recorded it as overshipped. Please review this case better and let me know what you think happened.

When a user is doing an over shipping or over landing of a container, please show a warning if the container is not created in the system. They should be able to create container there, but please we need to avoid typos. I have seen you have validation for container field, but if the container is not created at that moment please show a warning or something so they can double check before create the container.

Good morning team, On a few occasions we have trucks that return to the Terminal to dropp off two (2) empty 20’’ on the same chassis. It can happen during delivery as well. Is it possible to have an additional field to insert both containers that are being dropped off? For the time being we give him the dropp off interchange for the first container and immediately put the truck out to give him the second dropp off interchange. Thanks to let me know if it’s possible.

Good evening gents, We started implementing the feature where on the same window we do a Drop Off and a Pick Up. However, it seems that when the truck is gating out and we do the Delivery Receipt it reprints the Drop Off interchange again. Can you please have a look for us?

Good morning Cetus Lab team, In regards to below correspondence is it possible to format the system for EG containers to have 21 days (confirmed by the agency) from the time of unloading for the DECSA HOLD to appear? Thanks to let us know if it’s possible. Best Regards, **Marc-Aleix Gardere** Delivery and Customer Manager Caribbean Port Services S.A.

This would avoid unnecessary delays to the clients. Let me know if it is possible. Thanks and BRegards, **Marc-Aleix Gardere** Delivery and Customer Manager Caribbean Port Services S.A.
